Using the diff helps me easier to find the bugs.
Using diff makes me focus only on the differences.

Acessing to the whole history allows me to correct the bugs from the beginning.
Let me know in which time step we made a mistake.

Manual Save vs. Auto Save
Pros:
- Decide when to commit
- Save space (to save small, unnecessary commits)
Cons:
- Cannot get the best version before something happens 

Git and other VCSs allow you to save multiple files in one commit,
others like Google Docs, treat each file separately. Why?
- If files are related, saving multiple files in one commit is better.
